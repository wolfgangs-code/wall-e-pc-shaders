# Wall-E PC Shaders (Original)
This branch contains the original, unmodified shaders for *Wall-E* on Windows.

For modernized shaders that maintain the original art style,
refer to the ['main' branch](https://github.com/wolfgangs-code/wall-e-pc-shaders/tree/main).

To restore the original shaders,
you can place these files in the install path `\WALL E\LIBPC_Common\shaders`,
in which they will recompile upon launch.

These are sourced from the Steam release of the game.
