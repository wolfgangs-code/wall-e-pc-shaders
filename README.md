# Wall-E PC Shaders
This repository contains custom, modernized shaders for *Wall-E* on Windows.

For the original, unmodified shaders that ship with the game,
refer to the ['original' branch](https://github.com/wolfgangs-code/wall-e-pc-shaders/tree/original).

You can place these shaders in the install path `\WALL E\LIBPC_Common\shaders`,
in which they will recompile upon launch.

These are based on the Steam release of the game.
While only tested on Windows, this *should* work on Linux as testing is done within a DXVK wrapper.
